# LSST_Training_Program

Proposal for an LSST training program

With a new generation of ground and space-based surveys generating petabytes of data per year, together with the increasing complexity of data coming from these instruments, astrophysics is becoming ever more dependent on developments in computing. There is, however, a disconnect between the skills that are needed for an era rich in data and those that we teach to incoming graduate students and early-career postdocs. We propose here a program that will enhance a traditional physics curriculum; extending a strong physics education to one that encompasses computational techniques, programming skills, data management, statistics, and data analysis.
